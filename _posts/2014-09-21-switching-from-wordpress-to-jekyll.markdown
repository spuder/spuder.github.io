The privous blog was feeling pretty dated. Not wanting to pay to upgrade to wordpress pro, nor wanting to manage my own hosted wordpress site, I've decided to switch to jekyll and github.io

You can still find the old site here: [spuder.wordpress.com](http://spuder.wordpress.com)

If you want to host your own blog on github.io, checkout the following tutorials.
